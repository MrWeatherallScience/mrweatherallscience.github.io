# Welcome

Welcome to Level 2 Physics at MVHS. I intend this course to be taught in person alongside the resources provided on this website.


# Maths and Formulae

Physics uses Maths, there's no getting around that. For Level 2 physics you need to be comfortable with algebra, powers of 10, trigonomic functions, sin and cosine graphs, area and volume of geometric shapes, cartesian coordinates. There is no calculus in our course at level 2 or level 3 but you can study Calculus in the maths department at Level 3 - if you are considering studying Physics or Engineering at university this is important.
